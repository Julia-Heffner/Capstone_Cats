Introduction

Welcome to my Capstone Project all about CATS!
I have pulled three datasets about pet cats from the United States, Australia, and the UK, which can be found at the following links:
[Pet Cats UK](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/pet-cats-uk?select=cats_uk_reference.csv)
[Pet Cats Australia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/pet-cats-australia?select=Pet+Cats+Australia-reference-data.csv)
[Pet Cats United States](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/pet-cats-usa?select=Pet+Cats+United+States-reference-data.csv)

This project aims to explore the relationship between pet cats, their age/sex, and the amount of prey they hunt between three different countries (United States, Australia, and the UK). 

Questions: 
* Does the country a cat lives in affect its hunting capabilities?
* Which age group and/or sex averages the most prey kills?
* Does being spayed or neutered have an affect on prey kills?

Requirements:
The necessary libraries to be installed are listed in the 'Requirements.txt' folder.

This project was created using Jupyter Notebook in a virtual python environment.

To run this project, it is necessary to do the following:
* Clone the repository to your local machine
* If you would like to use a virtual environment, follow the steps in the chart below

* Navigate to the cloned repo folder in the terminal and run:
pip install -r requirements

In case there is a problem with this method I have included a list of the libraries below to be installed individually:
